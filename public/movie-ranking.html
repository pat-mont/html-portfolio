<hr />

<h3>Amélie</h3>
<p>This is my best french movie ever.</p>

<h3>Don't Look Up</h3>
<p>The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as astronomers who discover the planet-killing comet.</p>

<h3>Miś</h3>
<p>Polish comedy film directed by Stanisław Bareja. Teddy Bear, along with The Cruise (Rejs), was a reflection of contemporary Polish society using surreal humor to somehow get past the censorship at the time. It gained cult status in its native country.</p>
